# my-browser-startup-page

This is a browser startup page that you can save links to. It's as simple as it gets: no clutter, no bells and whistles, just links. The built-in ones are great, but often they come with a lot of extra features that can be distracting. Imagine waking up to a page full of news articles or ads. Not cool. This startup page is just a simple list of links that you can customize to your heart's content. It's like having a personalized links bar that opens up every time you start your browser.


Here's the tech stack:

- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS (Shadcn-svelte)
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore)

Feel free to modify the code to customize it.
